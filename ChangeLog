	* Added infinite recursion detection.  It should work.

2004-10-29  J. Tang  <tang@jtang.org>

	* Added more comments; upped version to 1.0.

	* Added --version flag to display taccle version.
	
	* Added infix_calc.tac as example of how to do precedence.
	
	* Added operator precedence (%left, %right, %nonassoc, and
	%prec).  Seems to work, at least with the example from the bison
	info manual.

	* Discovered obscure error when calculating FIRST and FOLLOW sets
	given a rule of the form:  x -> A x A
	(i.e., when the rule recurses with a terminal following the lhs
	token)

	* Added -w to enable warnings display.

	* Added write_array procedure to better format state transition
	tables.  Thanks to jcw for suggestion.

2004-09-08  J. Tang  <tang@jtang.org>

	* As a result of working epsilons, added embedded actions.

	* Fixed epsilon transitions by adding FOLLOW sets.  Double Woot!

2004-08-18  J. Tang  <tang@jtang.org>

	* Added epsilon transitions.  Woot!

	* Renamed synthesized attributes to just $1, $2... Renamed $yy_
	to $_.  (Yup, $_ like in Perl.)  Thanks to Matt Newman for
	suggestion.	

	* Added error terminal and error recovery (though no yyerrok).
	See interactive_calculator.tac example.
